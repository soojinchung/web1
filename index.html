<h2>The Cutiest Puppies 세상에서 가장 귀여운 강아지들</h2>
<img src="spitz.jpg" width="100%"><strong>Jadu</strong>(5, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shih_Tzu" target="_blank" title="시츄">Sitzu</a>) <u>Jamong</u>(3,Sitzu)<p>She came to my house in September 2014 and was a very small puppy weighing 2 kilograms. I thought Jadu was a cotton ball at first. So Chuseok in 2014 Jadu became our family and on February 23, 2015, I want to live well, and I do a big job on my 20th birthday. That's what Jadu left home. I searched frantically for her at the time, and after three days I found him with the help of an acquaintance.</p>
<p> And in September 2016, Jadu had four babies. Three daughters, one son. And there was only one son left to be our family, and this is Jamong. Jadu and Jamong(Jadumong) are precious to me.</p>
